			<p>Random facts about me but not useful to you<br>
			In Korea, we call it 'TMI' which stands for 'Too Much Information'<br>
			So it would be my TMI.<br><br>
			1. I am terrible at rolling my tongue. I was interested in Spanish, so I was trying
			to learn it by myself. But in the end, I gave up because I failed to pronounce 'rr'
			sound in Spanish even if I practiced it for 2 months. So I just took the Spanish class
			last semester in my home university.<br><br>
			2. When I was baby, I was hit by the piece of a dish, so I got emergency surgery.
			That piece was from the women who was sitting next to us, she was supposed to thraw
			the dish to her husband. How tragic it was!<br><br>
			3. I'm majoring in Engineering but I'd never thinking of myself majoring in it before.<br>
