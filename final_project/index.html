		<h2>Info</h2>
		<p>Welcome to Carmel, also known as Carmel-By-The-Sea! This little
		village lies on the Carmel River and Carmel Bay, and is only less
		than 15 minutes away from	Monterey. Carmel is dominated by tourist
		attrations and activities, such as the 17 Mile Drive to Pacific
		Grove, eating at one of a kind restaurants, or just relax and enjoy
		the views.</p>
		<h2> Fun Facts </h2>
		<h3>Former Mayor</h3>
		<p>Dirty Harry. Gran Torino. Unforgiven. What do these movies and
			Carmel have in common with each other? You guessed it. Clint Eastwood!
			Clint Eastwood was elected for mayor of Carmel and ran one term from
			1986 to 1988.</p>
		<h3>Chain Restaurants</h3>
		<p> Do you want to go eat as a one of a kind shop for coffee,
			sandwiches, or even some wine? In Carmel, there are no chain
			restaurants! Head to a small business or family owned shop
			to enjoy fine-dinging and casual cuisine.</p>
		<h3>Banning of Shoes?</h3>
		<p>In Carmel, you're more likely to wear some comfortable
			shoes or sandals since you're going to be walking a lot. However,
			you're more less likely to be wearing high heels or see people
			in high heels. Why? Because high heels are banned in Carmel! The muncipal
			cofe of Carmel bans high heels that are more than 2 inches in height
			and less than one square inch. If you wanted to wear high heels,
			supposedly, you're supposed to get a permit at City Hall.
			Don't worry, it's free of charge.</p>

		<h1>Big sur</h1>
		<p>renowned worldwide for its natural features and relatively pristine scenery</p>

		<h3>Info</h3>
		<p>Big Sur is located along Scenic Highway One approximately 150 miles
			south of San Francisco and 300 miles north of Los Angeles.
			Historically, the name Big Sur was derived from that unexplored and
			unmapped wilderness area that lies along the coast south of Monterey.
			It was simply called ‘El Sur Grande’, The Big South. Today, Big Sur
			refers to that 90-mile stretch of rugged and awesomely beautiful coastline
			between Carmel to the north and San Simeon (Hearst Castle) to the south.
			Highway One winds along its length and is flanked on one
			side by the majestic Santa Lucia Mountains and on the other by the rocky Pacific Coast.
